# Report template

**Note:** based on the 2025 CVPR/ICCV/3DV Official LaTeX template (see [cvpr-org](https://github.com/cvpr-org/author-kit)).

can you please add citations for each paper that shares categories with other papers? For instance for the row corresponding to the item G2011 add the following:  G2011\newline\cite{chetlur_cudnn_2014, Jia.EtAl_2014a}. As you can see both G2011 and G2031 share the Scalability category. As a result both rows (G2011 and G2031) should have references to each other. Only consider the highlighted section. Please apply the concept to all items in the highligyhted area.. If there are shared categories, add references to one another for every row. Also, please note that the line containing the label should be left as it is. The reference on this line represents the reference to the current item on that line.


can you please merge the critical factors present in @critical_factors.tex ? Merge them with the existing data present in @translation_critical_factors.tex
