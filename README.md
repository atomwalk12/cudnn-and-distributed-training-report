Can you please give information about each paper when assessing against each of the following categories? Please make sure to highlight the paper and for each category try to divide the information into subcategories. What i mean by this is to take as example the following: for the category task domain you can come up with the subcategories: image classification, object detection, object localisation, etc.


My categories are the following: deployment, model architectures, task domains, evaluation and infrastructure. Please pay special attention to focusing on the details that concern CUDA and possibly GPU programming.


# Report template

**Note:** based on the 2025 CVPR/ICCV/3DV Official LaTeX template (see [cvpr-org](https://github.com/cvpr-org/author-kit)).

can you please add citations for each paper that shares categories with other papers? For instance for the row corresponding to the item G2011 add the following:  G2011\newline\cite{chetlur_cudnn_2014, Jia.EtAl_2014a}. As you can see both G2011 and G2021 share the Scalability category. As a result both rows (G2011 and G2021) should have references to each other. Only consider the highlighted section. Please apply the concept to all items in the highligyhted area.. If there are shared categories, add references to one another for every row. Also, please note that the line containing the label should be left as it is. The reference on this line represents the reference to the current item on that line.


can you please merge the critical factors present in @critical_factors.tex ? Merge them with the existing data present in @translation_critical_factors.tex

Okay, let's merge these categories as well, following the same approach of grouping similar concepts and creating broader, unique categories.

Certainly! Here are the merged categories with the original categories that were merged into them appended:

*   **Deployment Strategies**
    *   *(Merged from: Deployment via Google Apps)*

*   **Model Architectures**
    *   *(Merged from: Models: MoEs)*

*   **Task Domains**
    *   *(Merged from: Image Classification, Multilingual Neural Machine Translation, Tasks: NLP, Vision, Tasks: RL, Tasks: NLP)*

*   **Evaluation & Performance Metrics**
    *   *(Merged from: Cross-platform evaluation (TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet), Performance, Performance, Performance, Performance)*

*   **Scalability & Infrastructure**
    *   *(Merged from: Scaling)*

**Explanation of the Appended Information:**

For each merged category, the list in parentheses "*(Merged from: ...)*" shows exactly which of the initial categories contributed to forming that broader category.  This makes it very clear how the original list was consolidated and organized into the new, unique categories.

**Analysis of the Second List:**

*   **Redundancy:** "Resource under-utilization" and "Communication overhead" are repeated.
*   **Related Concepts:** Many items point to challenges or limitations in usability, efficiency, design, and algorithms.
*   **Contradictions (but informative):** "Common API with other frameworks" and "No shared API with common frameworks" are opposites, suggesting inconsistency or a lack of a universally adopted API approach.

**Merged Categories Proposal:**

Here's a proposed set of merged categories, designed to be more comprehensive and unique:

*   **1. Usability and Integration:**
    *   *Combines:* "Ease of use," "Common API with other frameworks," "No shared API with common frameworks," "Error prone utilization," "Manual hyperparameter tuning"
    *   *Rationale:* This category focuses on how easy the system is to use for developers and researchers, and how well it integrates with existing tools and workflows.  API compatibility directly impacts ease of use and integration. "Error prone utilization" and "Manual hyperparameter tuning" also point to usability challenges.

*   **2. Resource Efficiency & Optimization:**
    *   *Combines:* "Resource under-utilization" (all instances), "Redundant computation," "Optimization challenges"
    *   *Rationale:* This category addresses issues related to the efficient use of computational resources. "Resource under-utilization" is a direct indicator of inefficiency. "Redundant computation" wastes resources, and "Optimization challenges" highlight difficulties in achieving optimal resource usage.

*   **3. Communication Overhead & Scalability:**
    *   *Combines:* "Communication overhead" (both instances), "Cross-node communication challenges"
    *   *Rationale:* This category focuses on the overhead and challenges related to communication, especially in distributed setups.  "Cross-node communication challenges" directly relates to communication overhead in distributed systems, which is a crucial factor in scalability.

*   **4. Algorithmic and Model Parallelism Limitations:**
    *   *Combines:* "No efficient model parallelism algorithms," "No optimal algorithm for all use cases"
    *   *Rationale:* This category highlights limitations in the algorithms and techniques available, specifically concerning model parallelism (distributing models across multiple devices) and the general lack of universally optimal algorithms.

*   **5. Architectural Design Constraints:**
    *   *Combines:* "Designed for homogeneous setup," "Tight coupling of components," "Multiple programming paradigms"
    *   *Rationale:* This category addresses limitations arising from the system's architectural design. "Designed for homogeneous setup" restricts flexibility. "Tight coupling" can hinder modularity and adaptability. "Multiple programming paradigms" can increase complexity and make the system harder to manage and reason about.

*   **6. External Collaboration Challenges:**
    *   *Combines:* "Collaboration with external teams"
    *   *Rationale:* This is a distinct category focusing on the challenges related to collaboration, specifically with external teams. It is more about the development process and organizational aspects than purely technical limitations.

**Final Merged Category List with Original Categories Appended:**

Here's the refined list with the original categories listed under each:

*   **Usability and Integration**
    *   *(Merged from: Ease of use, Common API with other frameworks, No shared API with com- mon frameworks, Error prone utilization, Manual hyperparameter tuning)*

*   **Resource Efficiency & Optimization**
    *   *(Merged from: Resource under-utilization, Resource under-utilization, Resource under-utilization, Redundant computation, Optimization challenges)*

*   **Communication Overhead & Scalability**
    *   *(Merged from: Communication overhead, Communication overhead, Cross-node communica- tion challenges)*

*   **Algorithmic and Model Parallelism Limitations**
    *   *(Merged from: No efficient model paral- lelism algorithms, No optimal algorithm for all use cases)*

*   **Architectural Design Constraints**
    *   *(Merged from: Designed for homoge- neous setup, Tight coupling of compo- nents, Multiple programming paradigms)*

*   **External Collaboration Challenges**
    *   *(Merged from: Collaboration with exter- nal teams)*

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **Consolidation:**  Redundant entries are grouped.
*   **Thematic Grouping:** Categories are based on overarching themes like usability, efficiency, communication, algorithms, and architecture.
*   **Clarity and Distinction:** Each merged category is now a unique aspect, making the list more structured and easier to understand the different types of challenges being addressed.
*   **Inclusion of Contrasting Points:** The seemingly contradictory API points are combined under "Usability and Integration" to represent the broader issue of API consistency and ease of use.

This merged list provides a much more organized and insightful view of the challenges presented in the original second list of categories.
