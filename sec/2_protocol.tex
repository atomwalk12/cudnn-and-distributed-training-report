\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}

\TODO{Reference the related work on survying the present methods both in DDL and CUDA}

Related work focuses on techniques and algorithms for training deep learning models across multiple
machines \cite{dehghani_distributed_2023, chahal_hitchhikers_2018, berloco_systematic_2022}. These
sources explore various aspects of DDL, such as parallelization techniques and communication
methods. However, our contribution emphasizes the connection between DDL and GPU programming with
CUDA. Furthermore, this study details the main libraries for DDL and GPU programming. We will also
provide practical guidance on running a small neural network in CUDA and facilitating PyTorch
Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) programming using Docker, addressing a practical implementation gap
not covered in the previous work. \TODO{Highlight related surveys concerning CUDA}

This study follows primarily the guidelines described in \cite{keele_systematic_2007}, however
advice for conducting the review is synthesized from a wider range of related articles
\cite{brereton_lessons_2007-1,kitchenham_procedures_nodate,budgen_reporting_2018,dos_santos_sustainable_2024}.

Distributed training of neural networks has become essential for modern deep learning applications
due to increasing model complexity and dataset sizes \cite{chahal_hitchhikers_2018}. The main
approaches for distributing neural network training can be categorized into several key strategies
\cite{dehghani_distributed_2023}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Data Parallelism:}
	      The dataset is divided across multiple nodes, with each node training a complete copy of the
	      model on its portion of data. Gradients from all nodes are then combined to update the model parameters.
	      This approach can be implemented either synchronously (all nodes wait for each other) or asynchronously (nodes work independently).

	\item \textbf{Model Parallelism:}
	      The neural network model itself is divided across different nodes, with each node responsible
	      for computing a specific portion of the model architecture. This strategy is particularly useful
	      when the model is too large to fit on a single machine.

	\item \textbf{Pipeline Parallelism:}
	      The training process is divided into sequential stages, similar to an assembly line,
	      where the output of one stage becomes the input for the next. This allows different parts
	      of the model to train simultaneously while maintaining dependencies.

	\item \textbf{Hybrid Parallelism:}
	      This approach combines multiple parallelization strategies to optimize training efficiency.
	      For example, model parallelism might be used to distribute a large model across GPUs, while
	      data parallelism is applied to each model segment.
\end{itemize}

These approaches can be further enhanced through techniques such as gradient compression, mixed
precision training, and tensor fusion \cite{dehghani_distributed_2023}. The choice of specific
techniques depends on factors including model architecture, available hardware, and training
requirements. For a comprehensive review of these techniques and their implementations, readers are
referred to \cite{chahal_hitchhikers_2018}.

\section{Research method}
\label{sec:protocol}

Multiple studies in the literature emphasize that a literature survey should be both transparent
and replicable \cite{keele_systematic_2007, dos_santos_sustainable_2024-1}, the main reason being
that this allows to minimize reviewer bias. This is a valid concern in general, however especially
so in this survey since it is conducted by only one person. In a broader study, bias would normally
be minimized by having multiple iterations with more than one reviewer involved. In this paper,
steps have been taken to mitigate this bias, acknowledging that it is not possible to eliminate it
completely. To ensure this, the process is documented and most of the resulting artifacts are
present in the text and in the Appendix.

% TODO these are all good but was hoping to minimize the number of citations
% TODO \cite{keele_systematic_2007,brereton_lessons_2007-1,budgen_reporting_2018, dos_santos_sustainable_2024-1},

% Now detail Step 1 content
The workflow is shown in Figure \ref{fig:workflow} where the key phases are annotated as follows:
Getting Started (M.1, M.2), Planning the Review (M.3, M.4), Conducting the Review (M.5, M.6), and
Reporting the Review (M.7, M.8). M.2 calls an auxiliary process composed of S.1 and S.2 to select
the appropriate studies \TODO{add references across the paper}.

\subsection{M.1 -- The need for a survey}
\label{sec:need_for_survey}

\textbf{Importance of the topic.}
Distributed techniques are important in neural networks because they allow models with billions of
parameters to perform a large number of computations in a reasonable amount of time. One of the
pioneering papers in machine learning that made use of GPUs to train neural networks in parallel
(AlexNet \cite{krizhevsky_imagenet_2012}), mentioned that the network took "between five and six days to
train on two GTX 580 3GB GPUs", suggesting that the training time would have taken much longer on a
CPU.

One key property of distributing neural network architectures to a larger number of parameters, is
that one can achieve better generalization and lower error rates even when training on smaller
datasets \cite{kaplan_scaling_2020}. This gives the impression of intelligence due to the model's
ability to make predictions that seem insightful. Understanding innate details on how these
libraries function, can provides a fertile foundation for future ideas.

\textbf{Learning outcomes.}
As a result of conducting the survey I expect the following learning outcomes: learn from the primary
studies, improve writing and research skills, gain practical experimental expertise using CUDA and
Pytorch DDP and identify potential research ideas for future projects.

\subsection{M.2 -- Getting started}
\label{sec:research_questions}
Building on the learning outcomes defined in Section \ref{sec:need_for_survey}, we define
the goals, expected outputs and constraints. The main goal was to analyze parallelization frameworks in DDL and CUDA.
The expected results were to identify key frameworks for each category. For this, we defined two main constraints: (i)
we only considered frameworks that introduce CUDA and DDL frameworks and (ii) we included only primary
studies that were peer-reviewed, i.e. literature surveys were used to gain familiarity with the topic,
however they are only discussed in Section \ref{sec:related_work}. These ideas are formally defined
in Section \TODO{...} and \TODO{...}.

\subsection{M.3 -- Selection of Relevant Studies}
This step identified and selected studies from both areas (CUDA programming and DDL). I collected
studies of the state of the art of both CUDA frameworks (in Step S.1) and DDL libraries (in Step
S.2).

\subsubsection{S.1 -- Survey on CUDA programming libraries}
\paragraph{S.1.1 -- Problem definition.}
In order to identify interesting frameworks and broaden the understanding of the topic, I conducted
a secondary study\footnote{A secondary study synthesizes primary papers to provide a comprehensive
	overview. This contrasts with tertiary studies which analyze secondary studies.}. This decision was
made in the problem definition step (S.1.1 in Figure \ref{fig:workflow-study}). In order to do this
systematically, this section defines a research protocol during the planning phase, which is then
used to find related studies. The research protocol is essentially a framework for conducting the
review. This section outlines the key decisions that were made with to create the protocol by
identifying the research questions and search strategy.

\begin{figure*}[th]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/workflow3}
	\caption{The diagram suggests the key steps for finding papers related to the CUDA programming survey. The phases
		include planning the review (aims, research questions, search strategy) and conducting the review (study selection phase). The research questions
		were transformed according to the PICOC (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Context) criterion suggested by \cite{keele_systematic_2007}.}.
	\label{fig:workflow-study}
\end{figure*}

\paragraph{S.1.2 -- Research questions.}
After an initial literature review, the research questions (RQ) defined in Section
\ref{sec:initial_research_questions} are refined using the guidelines defined in
\cite{kitchenham_evidence-based_2015} and \cite{keele_systematic_2007}. Specifically, the PICOC
(Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Context) criterion is used to transform the
questions into a format that ensures them to be specific, measurable and well-defined. The
questions below are ordered based on their significance in the survey:

% TODO: remove this
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{1}} What are the most common frameworks currently available for 
% 		  GPU programming with CUDA, and how do their usability compare?
% 		  % NOTE implementing distributed deep learning, and how does their usability compare?
% 	      % NOTE \cite{berloco_systematic_2022, ben-nun_demystifying_2020, langer_distributed_2020}?
% 	      % NOTE \item How do parameter update strategies impact distributed deep learning systems (e.g., Parameter Server and decentralised approaches) \cite{ben-nun_demystifying_2020,berloco_systematic_2022,langer_distributed_2020}?
% 	\item How is stochastic gradient descent (SGD) computed in distributed environments
% 	      \cite{berloco_systematic_2022,ben-nun_demystifying_2020,langer_distributed_2020,verbraeken_survey_2021}? % NOTE and what are the associated challenges 
% 	\item What are the key frameworks currently available for implementing DDL, and how do their features 
% 	      compare \cite{berloco_systematic_2022}?
%  	\item In what ways are the techniques used in DDL also useful in GPU parallelization?
% \end{itemize}

% TODO: \TODO{RQ1: ease of learning, ease of use and documentation compare?}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{1}:} In the context of Deep Learning, what are the most common
	      frameworks (based on mentions in the literature) currently available for GPU CUDA programming,
	      and how do their user base compare? \\
	      \textit{Rationale:} By identifying the most common frameworks, we can identify which are the gaps
	      in the literature they cover and which are the most promising areas for future research.

	\item \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{2}:} What are the most common frameworks (also based on mentions in the literature)
	      currently available for implementing DDL, and how do their features (in terms of distributed training techniques) and user base compare? \\
	      \textit{Rationale:} By identifying the most common frameworks, we can trace the years in which they were published
	      and form a unified timeline of the evolution of the field with respect to the related CUDA programming advancements.

	\item \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{3}:} What practical applications of these technologies have been reported in the literature? \\
	      \textit{Rationale:} This can yield hands-on experience on the topic which is helpful for practical applications.
	\item \textbf{RQ\textsubscript{4}:} What are the overlaps in data/model optimization strategies used in DDL and GPU parallelization? \\
	      \textit{Rationale:} By identifying the overlaps, it offers a more unified view of how the concepts are interrelated.
\end{itemize}

The questions play a key role in guiding the search strategy, data extraction process and results
synthesis phase.

\paragraph{S.1.3 -- Search Strategy.}
The search strategy represents represents a systematic approach for identifying relevant studies that
adequately answer the research questions.

\textbf{Databases.}
The search process includes a manual search of specific citation databases that include conference
proceedings and journal papers in four electronic libraries -- \href{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/}{IEEE Xplore}, \href{https://dl.acm.org/}{ACM Digital Library}, \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/}{Science Direct}, and \href{https://www.scopus.com/}{Scopus} -- 
and considering three metadata fields (title, abstract, and keywords).

\textbf{Search terms.}
A number of search strings were constructed using relevant terms deduced from the research. The initial
search strings are shown in the Appendix in Table \ref{tab:search_terms}. These terms are combined in Table \ref{tab:search_documentation},
using boolean operators to generate query strings, which are then used to search each individual database.

The search was restricted to papers published between $\yearstartcuda$-$\yearendcuda$ for the CUDA
task and $\yearstartddl$-$\yearendddl$ for the DDL task. The former start year ($\yearstartcuda$)
was chosen as the baseline due to being the year when AlexNet \cite{krizhevsky_imagenet_2012} was
published. This paper revolutionized research in neural networks by allowing advanced AI models to
be trained on GPUs.

The latter start year ($\yearstartddl$) was chosen as at this point there was a shift towards
resource conservation, which resulted in a focus on concurrency within mini-batches
\cite{ben-nun_demystifying_2020}. This is the year by which the effectiveness of deep learning
algorithms was more widely recognized and more research was published that focused on scalability.

\textbf{Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria.}
There were also defined two inclusion criteria (IC) and five exclusion criteria (EC). In
particular, I decided to select only primary studies, however secondary studies were mentioned in
Section \ref{sec:related_work}. The identification of secondary studies can be a good strategy,
since the selected studies synthesize evidence and can make it possible to access primary studies:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{IC\textsubscript{1}} Study is a primary study and is peer-reviewed.
	\item \textbf{IC\textsubscript{2}} Study addresses distributed frameworks in DL.
	\item \textbf{IC\textsubscript{3}} Study addresses GPU programming with CUDA.
	\item \textbf{IC\textsubscript{4}} Study introduces a library or a framework. \\
	\item \textbf{EC\textsubscript{1}} Study does not discuss implementation details.
	\item \textbf{EC\textsubscript{2}} Study is not a primary study.
	\item \textbf{EC\textsubscript{3}} Study is not written in English.
\end{itemize}

% ===== STEP 3: Selection of Relevant Studies =====
% This section details:
% - Study 1: Distributed learning techniques
% - Study 2: CUDA implementations
\subsection{Study Selection Framework}
\label{sec:study-selection}

% Combined "Purpose," "Scope," and "Relationship Between Study Types"
This section defines the aims and scope of the review, clarifying the types of studies to be
included and the rationale for exploring distributed learning and CUDA implementations together.
The specific objectives of the review are aligned with the associated research questions to provide
a clear focus. The boundaries of the review concern the types of distributed learning techniques
and CUDA implementations considered, with a time period between 2015 and 2022 to ensure currency.
The review includes studies focusing on the design and analysis of distributed learning algorithms
and those focusing on CUDA-based parallel implementations to understand the translation of
theoretical aspects into practical implementations. This approach allows for the exploration of
patterns and challenges in mapping distributed algorithms onto parallel architectures
\TODO{Different topics explored together}.

\subsubsection{Distributed Learning Techniques Review}
The review will focus on distributed learning approaches, aligning with "Study 1" in Figure
\ref{fig:workflow}, with the following considerations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Types of algorithms including \textbf{data parallelism, model parallelism, and asynchronous
		      Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)} \cite{ben-nun_demystifying_2020,langer_distributed_2020}.
	\item Different distributed architectures including parameter servers and peer-to-peer systems
	      \cite{verbraeken_survey_2021,ben-nun_demystifying_2020,langer_distributed_2020}.
	\item Specific machine learning models such as neural networks and support vector machines.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{CUDA-based Parallel Implementation Review}
For CUDA implementations, the review will consider aspects relevant to "Study 2" in Figure
\ref{fig:workflow}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Implementation of distributed methods on NVIDIA GPUs using the CUDA framework
	\item Different CUDA libraries and architectures
	\item Specific hardware considerations including GPUs and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Justification for Inclusion}
Both distributed learning techniques and CUDA implementation studies will be included to provide a
complete picture of the current state-of-the-art research in the area. By including both study
types, a deeper understanding of both theoretical approaches and implementation techniques for
practical applications can be reached.

\subsection{Preliminary Protocol Development}
This systematic review follows the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Charters for software
engineering research. The preliminary review protocol was developed to establish the foundation for
the steps visualized in Figure \ref{fig:workflow}, particularly in the initial stages. An overview
of the papers included after the initial selection phase (corresponding to the output of the
"Studies Selection" phase in Figure \ref{fig:workflow}) will be presented in Table 2.1.

\subsubsection{Background and Rationale}
This section provides the necessary context for the review, outlining the research gaps that will
be addressed \cite{ben-nun_demystifying_2020}. It explicitly states the need for a systematic
review of the current literature to address this gap and provide a focused analysis.

\subsubsection{Initial Search Strategy}
The initial search strategy involves combining keywords using Boolean and proximity operators to
generate search strings, based on the "Goals, expected outputs, constraints, search terms and
keywords" documented as an input to Step 1 in Figure \ref{fig:workflow}. Databases like Scopus,
Google Scholar, and ACM Digital Library are selected for their coverage of computer science,
engineering, and applied mathematics literature. Studies published between 2015-2022 will be
considered to ensure recent advancements are included while maintaining a consistent period for
analysis.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Search Terms:} Details of the search terms will be provided in Section \ref{sec:search_process_documentation}.
	\item \textbf{Database Justification:} Rationale for selecting specific databases is detailed in Section \ref{sec:search_process_documentation}.
	\item \textbf{Timeline:} The timeframe for including studies is 2015-2022.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Preliminary Selection Criteria}
Preliminary criteria for inclusion will use specific examples such as ``studies that evaluate the
performance of synchronous distributed SGD in deep learning models'' rather than general terms like
``distributed computing'' \cite{ben-nun_demystifying_2020}. Preliminary quality thresholds will
ensure only high-quality studies are included in the final analysis. Specific inclusion and
exclusion criteria are detailed in Section \ref{sec:study-selection-criteria}.

\subsubsection{Initial Data Extraction Plan}
The following information will be extracted from each study:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Details of distributed systems \cite{ben-nun_demystifying_2020,langer_distributed_2020}:
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Number of nodes
		      \item Communication network
		      \item Communication method
		      \item Topology
	      \end{enumerate}
	\item Machine learning algorithms and models used \cite{xing_strategies_2015}.
	\item Datasets and benchmarks \cite{ben-nun_demystifying_2020}.
	\item Performance metrics (training time, accuracy, speedup)
	      \cite{ben-nun_demystifying_2020,langer_distributed_2020,xing_strategies_2015}.
	\item CUDA implementation details (libraries, optimizations)
	      \cite{verbraeken_survey_2021,ben-nun_demystifying_2020,xing_strategies_2015}.
\end{itemize}
Further details on the data extraction strategy can be found in Section \ref{sec:data-extraction-strategy}.

\subsubsection{Quality Assessment Framework}
Preliminary quality assessment will use specific criteria to evaluate the validity and reliability
of methods, using established checklists from the literature \cite{ben-nun_demystifying_2020}. A
Likert scale will be used for a standardized approach. Detailed guidelines for reviewers will be
established to ensure consistency and prevent bias, as described further in Section
\ref{sec:quality-assessment-process}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Criteria:} Specific criteria are detailed in Section \ref{sec:quality-assessment-process}.
	\item \textbf{Scoring System:} A Likert scale will be used.
	\item \textbf{Guidelines:} Guidelines for reviewers are detailed in Section \ref{sec:quality-assessment-process}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Synthesis Approach}
The synthesis approach will involve meta-analysis where appropriate, using statistical analysis to
combine results from included studies with clearly defined methods
\cite{ben-nun_demystifying_2020}. Thematic synthesis will be used for narrative synthesis, allowing
an in-depth understanding of themes present in selected studies.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Meta-analysis:} Details of the methods will be defined later.
	\item \textbf{Narrative synthesis:} Thematic synthesis will be employed.
\end{itemize}

% Final paragraph about methodology
By using this methodology, the systematic review will aim to provide a comprehensive and reliable
analysis of the current state of research in distributed deep learning and CUDA implementations.
The approach used here will enable the review to identify any trends and gaps in current research
and make recommendations for future study.

\subsection{Study Selection Results}
\label{sec:study_selection_results}
