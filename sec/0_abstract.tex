This paper presents a systematic literature review of distributed techniques for parallelizing stochastic descent backpropagation in neural networks. The review synthesizes research from the past decade, examining various approaches to distributed training, their effectiveness, and implementation challenges. Our analysis covers [X] primary studies, identifying key patterns in algorithmic design, communication strategies, and convergence properties. The findings indicate [brief summary of key findings]. This review contributes to the field by providing a comprehensive overview of current distributed training techniques, highlighting research gaps, and suggesting future research directions. The work serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working on large-scale neural network training systems.
