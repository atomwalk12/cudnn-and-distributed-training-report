The starting date used for the analysis starts from 2014 till 2024. The reason for utilizing this range
is due to the publishing date of \cite{SierraCanto2010ParallelTO}, which acts as a key paper in the domain. As a result,

\section{Notes}

\subsubsection{Conducting the Review}
The stages associated with conducting the review are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Identification of research (See Section \TODO{Reference section number}).
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item \textbf{Initial Search:} This stage involves using the defined search terms within selected
		            databases to identify relevant studies, as further detailed in section \ref{sec:search_process_documentation} (Search Process Documentation). The process of how these terms are combined to create search
		            strings is described in section \ref{sec:search_process_documentation}, and the search results will be stored using \textbf{Zotero}.
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Selection of primary studies (See Section \TODO{Reference section number}).
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item \textbf{Screening:} This stage involves an initial screening of titles and abstracts to remove
		            irrelevant studies, which is part of the study selection process described in section \ref{sec:study-selection-criteria} (Study Selection Criteria).
		      \item \textbf{Full-Text Review:} All potentially relevant studies will have their full texts retrieved,
		            and the full texts will then be assessed against pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria (see section \ref{sec:study-selection-criteria}).
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Study quality assessment (See Section \TODO{Reference section number}).
	\item Data extraction and monitoring (See Section \TODO{Reference section number}).
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item \textbf{Data Extraction:} The final step is data extraction, where relevant information will be
		            extracted from the included studies using a predefined data extraction form (detailed in section \ref{sec:data-extraction-strategy}).
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Data synthesis (See Section \TODO{Reference section number}).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reporting the Review}
The stages associated with reporting the review are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Specifying dissemination mechanisms (See Section \TODO{Reference section number}).
	\item Formatting the main report (See Section \TODO{Reference section number}).
	\item Evaluating the report (See Section \TODO{Reference section number}).
\end{itemize}

We consider all the above stages to be mandatory except:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Commissioning a review which depends on whether or not the systematic review is being done on a
	      commercial basis.
	\item Evaluating the review protocol and Evaluating the report which are optional and depend on the
	      quality assurance procedures decided by the systematic review team (and any other stakeholders).
\end{itemize}

The stages listed above may appear to be sequential, but it is important to recognise that many of
the stages involve iteration. In particular, many activities are initiated during the protocol
development stage, and refined when the review proper takes place. For example:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The selection of primary studies is governed by inclusion and exclusion criteria. These criteria
	      are initially specified when the protocol is drafted but may be refined after quality criteria are
	      defined.
	\item Data extraction forms initially prepared during construction of the protocol will be amended when
	      quality criteria are agreed.
	\item Data synthesis methods defined in the protocol may be amended once data has been collected.
\end{itemize}
